# Drive-ProjectDir
Google Drive Project Folder Directory Generator

This is a standalone Google Apps script that generates a project folder directory based on any structure you provide. In addition to folders, the script is also able to generate empty labelled docs and spreadsheets.

### GETTING STARTED
1. [Click this link to grab a copy of the script.](https://script.google.com/d/11kNxQ48FK_hefdxynI6kiTkLPvqzM0eqFdV3sGL1HZChF-GY9amuiAx3/edit?usp=sharing&newcopy=true) It will automatically be saved to your drive.
2. Move this script to the folder where you would like the root of the folder directory to start. Open it.
3. Go to the Run menu and choose "createTemplateSheet". Run. A spreadsheet will be created in the same folder as this script.
4. Configure the folder structure in the provided spreadsheet to suit your fancy.
5. Once done, go to the Run menu and choose "generateFolderStructureFromSheet". Run. The folder structure will generate!

IMPORTANT: For the script to function, only ONE copy of it should exist in your drive when run.
           DO NOT CREATE DUPLICATES IN YOUR DRIVE. This is a limitation of the Google Script API.
